# Network Configuration for Expo Go

# Backend should be running on your machine's local IP address
# To find your IP on macOS: ifconfig | grep inet (look for 192.168.x.x)
# To find your IP on Windows: ipconfig (look for IPv4 Address under Wi-Fi adapter)

# The app now automatically detects IP via expo-network on mobile devices
# and falls back to localhost for web/development builds.

# No need to set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_HOST manually - it's automatic!
# But if you need to override, uncomment and set:
# EXPO_PUBLIC_API_HOST=192.168.1.100
